* Create a computers choice function.
* Add a math.random and math.floor property inside of the computers choice function that 
generates a random number between 1 and 3. 
* Below the math.random property inside of the computers choice function will be conditional 
statements that are dependant on the value of the random number. 
For example, if (randnum = 1) {
    console.log('paper') }
